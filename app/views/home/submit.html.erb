<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>

<p>Thank you for accepting the invitation to donate work to Momenta Art's benefit raffle.</p>

<p>All raffle tickets are being sold for $200 until the benefit opens and $250 thereafter until all tickets are sold. All ticket buyers are guaranteed to receive an artwork, as well as admission for two to
the raffle drawing party to be held at Momenta. At the party, in the order that tickets are randomly drawn, ticket holders will choose a work to keep. </p>

</p>All work must be dropped off at Momenta - at 56 Bogart Street in Bushwick - no later than <strong>April 21</strong>.</p>

<p>The Benefit Preview Exhibition will be held at Momenta from <strong>May 10 through May 26</strong>, with the drawing party to be held in the gallery on the 26th from 6 to 10pm. As a participating artist you are invited to attend.</p>

<h3>Practical Information</h3>


<ul>
  <li>Due to space restrictions please limit your donation to wall pieces no larger than 18" in any dimension and sculptural pieces no larger than 18" in any dimension.</li>

  <li>Every ticket holder will receive an artwork, so please keep in mind the ticket price of $250 when choosing which work to donate. Past donations have ranged from $100 to $5,000 in value, but artists can only claim a donation of up to $250 for tax purposes.</li>

  <li>The collection of 200 artworks is a big undertaking, so it will be greatly appreciated if work can be dropped off at Momenta (56 Bogart St) Saturday, April 6th, through Sunday, April 21. Drop off hours at Momenta are Friday through Monday,  noon to 6pm.
If you will be unable to get your work to us during these times, please call or email the gallery to make other arrangements (718-218-8058 or info@momentaart.org).</li>

  <li>We request (but do not require) that 2-dimensional works on paper be framed. The frames donâ€™t have to be expensive, but having one greatly increases the protection of the artwork and is greatly appreciated.</li>

  <li>Courtesy lines will be left blank if no one is indicated - We recommend "Courtesy of the artist" if you wish to indicate yourself. If you would like to identify a person or business as a contributor, please fill in the form exactly as you would like it to appear on our printed materials.</li>
